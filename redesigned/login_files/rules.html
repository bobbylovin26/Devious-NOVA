Account Sitting is allowed:<br>
<br>
Account sitting entitles a given player to have his account watched over under the following regulations:<br>
<br>
 - A GameOperator must be informed before the sitting takes place, by opening a ticket or by IRC contact.<br>
 - No Fleet movements are allowed while the account is being sat unless an attack that may raid or crash the account is incoming, in which case you may save your fleet(s) by deploying or transporting to a planet or to a moon owned by the account being sat. You may not ninja an incoming attack in cases where you would need to move a fleet for it.<br>
 - An account may only be sat for a maximum period of 12 continuous hours (GameOperators permission needs to be obtained in cases where a time extension is needed).<br>
<br>
 - The sitting period will be considered over if the actual owner logs in.<br>
 - No account may be sat during the first 3 weeks of a new universe.<br>
<br>
The sitter may, on the account being sat and while the sitting period lasts:<br>
<br>
 - Spend Resources on buildings or researches.<br>
 - Fleetsave any ship that imminently endangered by an incoming attacking fleet, only with a deployment or transport mission to one of the accounts own planets.<br>
 - Place an account into vacation mode.<br>
<br>
The sitter may not:<br>
<br>
 - Transport resources, neither between planets/moons of the account being sat, nor to any other planet/moon.<br>
 - Spend Resources on defensive structures or ships.<br>
 - Sit an account if he sat another one within the previous 7 days.<br>
 - Sit an account that was sat within the previous 7 days.<br>
 - Remove an account from vacation mode.</p>

This includes but is not limited to:<br>
<br>
 - Resources sent from a lower ranked account to a higher ranked one with nothing tangible in return.<br>
 - A player crashing his fleet into a higher ranked one for the higher ranked one to keep the Debris Field, and thus profiting from it.<br>
 - "Loans" that are not returned within 48 hours.<br>
 - Trades in which the higher ranked player does not return the resources within 48 hours.<br>
 - Players answering to a higher ranked player extortion by paying resources.<br>
 - Trades that mean an unfair profit to the higher ranked player by falling outside the following range of ratios:<br>
<br>
3:2:1 Where each unit of deuterium is worth 2 units of crystal or 3 units of metal.<br>
<br>
 2:1:1 Where each unit of deuterium is worth 1 unit of crystal or 2 units of metal.<br>
<br>
Note that a game team authority will proceed to post other approved trade ratios on the universes <a href="http://board.ogame.org/board.php?boardid=11" target="_blank">trade boards</a> when they need to be updated so this rule may not interfere with fair trading strategies.<br>
<br>
Note: If you unexpectedly receive resources from a lower ranked player, you cannot keep them. Contact your GO immediately and send the resources to the closest planed owned by a GO or by the player pushing you.<br>
<br>
Note: After a pushing ban is over you MUST send the resources back to the player who pushed you or to a nearby planet owned by a GameOperator.<br>
<br>
Recycling Help<br>
<br>
Sending resources to a higher ranked player after you helped him recycle a debris field is allowed ONLY after notifying a GameOperator, by opening a ticket or through IRC. There is no need to get GameOperators permission before sending the recyclers. But It needs to be done before the transport mission takes place.<br>
<br>ACS Splits<br>
<br>
Sending resources to higher ranked players who have taken part in an ACS Attack/Defend is allowed ONLY after notifying a GameOperator, by opening a ticket or through IRC, ACS splits are treated as recycling help.<br>

Bounties need to be acknowledged to the GameOperators before they happen. They can only be paid for after the conditions of the bounty have been fulfilled.</p>
